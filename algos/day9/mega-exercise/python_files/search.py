# Instructions:
# Fill out each of the functions below with the appropriate implementation.
# Then run the testing file.
# Note: the testing files assume the functions are named exactly as they are here (e.g., bfs, dfs, ucs, a_star)
# so please do not change the name.

# Also, we encourage you to write helper functions as necessary.

def bfs(grid, start, goal):
    pass

def dfs(grid, start, goal):
    pass

def ucs(grid, start, goal): # aka dijkstra
    pass

def a_star(grid, start, goal):
    pass
