# Interview Practice Questions

Compiled by Carl Shan.

## String Manipulation

1. Write a program that returns whether a string is a pangram. A pangram is a string that contains all 26 letters of the alphabet.
2. Write a program that returns whether a string is a palindrome.
3. Write a program that finds the longest palindrome in a string.
4. Write a function that returns a list of all the duplicate characters in a string.
5. Check if a string is an anagram of another string.
6. Write a function that will return if a string is a rotation of another given string.
7. Count occurrances of a word in a given string.

## Other Questions

1. Implement at least 3 different ways of finding the factorial of a number.
2. Count the number of ways that someone can fill a rectangular tile that is 1xN with some combination of `1x1` blue and `1x2` red pieces. A combination is considered unique if it looks unique.
3. Check to see if an equation has balanced parantheses.
4. Given a string that contains a filepath, with special characters `'.'` (meaning the current directory) and `'..'` (meaning the parent directory), implement a function that resolves this string to the appropriate filepath without the `'.'` and `'..'` characters.
5. Given two jugs that can contain water up to limits `A` and `B` respectively (e.g., 3 and 5), return the number of steps involved in order to have one of the jugs contain `target` units of water.
6. Implement Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search or Dijkstra's algorithm over a provided graph. What data structures did you choose and why?
7. Implement Binary Search recursively with and without indices over an aray.
8. Count the number of inversions in a list of numbers.
9. Solve [Frog 1](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_a).
   *  **Advanced**: Now solve [Frog 2](https://atcoder.jp/contests/dp/tasks/dp_b).
10. Given a knapsack with a specific carrying capacity `W`, determine the maximium value of items contained in the set `[ { "weight": 5, "value": 10 }, { "weight": 4, "value": 40 }, { "weight": 6, "value": 30 }, { "weight": 4, "value": 50 } ]` or any arbitrary set. (From Exercism).
11. Given an alphabet, return all `2` letter combinations of this alphabet. Now generalize to `N` letter combinations.
12. Given a lattice of height `h` and width `w`, how many unique shortest paths exist from the top left corner to the bottom right corner? For example, given a lattice with dimensions `h=w=2`, there are `6` unique paths.
